I'll analyze your idea for creating a self-optimizing context system where an AI can test and improve prompt designs automatically.

The concept is promising and would address inefficiencies in the current testing approach. Let's break down the key components and feasibility:

## Core Components Needed

1. **SubAgent Creation Tool**: Allow creation of testing agents with specific contexts
2. **Prompt Inspection Tool**: Retrieve the rendered prompt from a context
3. **Code Modification Tool**: Update context implementations based on test results
4. **Testing Framework**: Define scenarios and evaluate agent performance

## Architecture Analysis

From examining `context.ts` and `utils.ts`, I see your system already has:
- A flexible `ContextManager` that manages multiple contexts
- Well-defined interfaces for contexts with `renderPrompt()` methods
- RAG capabilities for enhanced context awareness

The codebase is structured to support extension with new tools, so adding these capabilities seems feasible.

## Implementation Approach

1. Create a new `PromptDesignerContext` with tools for:
   - Creating testing agents with specific contexts
   - Extracting and analyzing prompts
   - Running test scenarios
   - Modifying context implementations

2. Implement a feedback loop where the AI can:
   - Define test cases for a specific user requirement
   - Run tests with the current context design
   - Analyze performance gaps
   - Modify context implementations
   - Retest to verify improvements

## Potential Challenges

1. **Code Safety**: Allowing AI to modify code introduces security concerns
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Defining objective success criteria is difficult
3. **Resource Usage**: Running multiple test agents could be computationally expensive
4. **LLM Understanding**: The AI needs to understand both code and prompt engineering principles

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Create a more detailed implementation plan?
2. Start implementing a basic version of the SubAgent and PromptDesigner tools?
3. Focus on one specific aspect of this system first?
