```

### 2. Topic Analysis Phase

**Agent uses updateResearchTopicTool:**
```json
{
  "research_topic": "Latest developments in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic learning and multimodal AI"
}
```

**Agent uses updateRationaleTool:**
```json
{
  "rationale": "VLA models represent a frontier in AI research combining computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic control. To provide comprehensive coverage, we need to explore: (1) Recent model architectures like RT-2, Octo, and OpenVLA, (2) Performance metrics on robotic manipulation tasks, (3) Key research institutions and their contributions, (4) Technical innovations in multimodal fusion and action prediction, (5) Available open-source resources for researchers and developers."
}
```

**Agent uses updateQueriesTool:**
```json
{
  "queries": [
    "RT-2 RT-X Vision Language Action models Google DeepMind 2024",
    "OpenVLA open source vision language action model benchmarks",
    "Octo robotic transformer generalist robot policies 2024",
    "VLA models multimodal learning robotics manipulation latest research",
    "vision language action datasets Open X-Embodiment RoboNet"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Web Search Phase

**For each query, the agent:**
1. Uses WebSearchTool to search
2. Uses updateQueriesDoneTool to mark completed

Example for first query:
```
Agent uses WebSearchTool with query: "RT-2 RT-X Vision Language Action models Google DeepMind 2024"
```

After successful search:
```json
{
  "completed_query": "RT-2 RT-X Vision Language Action models Google DeepMind 2024"
}
```

### 4. Synthesis Phase

**Agent uses updateSummariesTool:**
```json
{
  "summaries": "## Latest Developments in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models\n\n### 1.

```

### 5. Reflection Phase

**Agent uses updateKnowledgeGapTool:**
```json
{
  "knowledge_gap": "Current research covers major models and benchmarks well, but lacks: (1) Comparison of computational requirements and inference speeds, (2) Specific industry applications and commercial deployments, (3) Challenges and limitations of current VLA approaches, (4) Future research directions and open problems"
}
```

**Agent uses updateIsSufficientTool:**
```json

  "is_sufficient": false
}
```

**Agent uses updateQueriesTool for additional searches:**
```json
{
  "queries": [
    "VLA models computational requirements inference speed comparison",
    "vision language action models commercial applications industry",
