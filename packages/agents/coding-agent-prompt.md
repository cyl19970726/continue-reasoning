# Coding Agent Prompt Structure and Rendering Process

## Overview

This document provides an introduction to the coding-agent's role and responsibilities, and describes how the prompt is built from multiple components including system instructions, execution history, and tool call results.

## 1. System Instructions

- Contains detailed guidelines, including coding guidelines, environment context, and mandatory workflows.
- Establishes initial responsibilities and operational constraints that guide the agent's behavior.

## 2. Execution History

- Maintains previous conversation steps including user messages, analysis steps, and the outcomes of previous tool calls.
- Each interaction entry is captured and added to the execution history.
- This history is crucial for context continuity and preserving the state across multiple interactions.

## 3. ToolCallResult Integration

- Outputs from executed tools (e.g., ReadFile, Grep, BashCommand) are appended into the prompt rendering process.
- These outputs provide dynamic context and shape subsequent prompts.
- The tool results help adjust and verify that the agent’s responses are correct and up-to-date.

## 4. Prompt Rendering Process

- **Step a:** Begin with the static system message and instructions.
- **Step b:** Merge the execution history: Include past conversation steps and tool outputs.
- **Step c:** Incorporate the most recent toolCallResult to update the context.
- **Step d:** Compile and render the final prompt that guides the assistant's current response.

## 5. Overall Flow

- Ensures that both the static operational guidelines and the dynamic user context are integrated.
- Enables the agent to dynamically update its behavior based on historical data and live tool output feedback.
- This modular approach provides clarity, adaptability, and consistency in the agent’s responses.

## Conclusion

The coding-agent prompt structure is designed for continuous reasoning, where every action is documented and integrated. The rendering process merges static instructions with dynamic context provided by execution history and tool call outputs, ensuring an informed and adaptive response.
