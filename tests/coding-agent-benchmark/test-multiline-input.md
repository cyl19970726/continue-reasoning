# Multi-line Test Instructions

This is a test file to demonstrate the new multi-line input capabilities of the HHH-AGI CLI client.

## Test Scenario

Please create a simple Node.js application with the following requirements:

1. **Project Structure**:
   ```
   my-app/
   ├── package.json
   ├── src/
   │   ├── index.js
   │   ├── utils/
   │   │   └── helpers.js
   │   └── config/
   │       └── settings.js
   └── README.md
   ```

2. **Functionality**:
   - The main `index.js` should import utilities and configuration
   - Create a simple HTTP server that responds with "Hello World"
   - Include proper error handling
   - Add logging functionality

3. **Configuration**:
   - Port should be configurable via environment variable
   - Default port: 3000
   - Include development and production settings

4. **Package.json**:
   - Include start script
   - Include dev dependencies for development
   - Set proper metadata (name, version, description)

This multi-line instruction tests the agent's ability to:
- Handle complex, structured requirements
- Create multiple files and directories
- Implement proper Node.js patterns
- Follow best practices for project structure

Please implement this step by step and provide explanations for your choices.
